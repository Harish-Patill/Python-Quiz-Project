# Python-Quiz-Project

## Description:
This Python Quiz Project allows you to conduct an interactive quiz through the terminal. The questions and answers are stored in a dictionary (questions_and_answers) which you can easily update before running the program. When executed, the program presents each question to the user, accepts their input as the answer, and checks it against the correct answer.

The program keeps track of the user’s score throughout the quiz and displays the final score at the end.

## Features:

- Interactive terminal-based quiz
- Easy updating of questions and answers via a dictionary
- Real-time answer checking
- Score tracking and final score display

## How it works:

- Questions and answers are stored in a dictionary where keys are questions and values are their correct answers.
- The program loops through each question, prompts the user for an answer, and verifies it.
- User’s score is incremented for every correct answer.
- After all questions, the total score is shown.
